# Mini Blockchain (Python)

This repository contains a simple, well-structured implementation of a mini blockchain system written in Python.  
It was created as part of an academic project to demonstrate the fundamental concepts behind blockchain technology.

The project covers essential blockchain mechanisms, including:

- **Block structure** (index, timestamp, data, previous hash, nonce)  
- **SHA-256 hashing**  
- **Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining**  
- **Genesis block creation**  
- **Chain validation** (detecting tampering, verifying difficulty)

The code is intentionally minimal and educational, making it easy to understand how blockchain systems work internally.
